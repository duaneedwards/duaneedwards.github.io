#Details Here "[Build Your First F# Mobile App](http://blog.xamarin.com/contest-build-your-first-f-mobile-app/)"

The deadline for submissions is the 21st of July, which gives me just over two weeks to build an F# Xamarin based application.

I've been curious about F# and played around it a little recently (nothing too adventurous).  This contest looks like an interesting little project to get me into a bit more substantial F# development with the Xamarin toolkit.

My submission is likely to be a simple Android application of something that I'd be needing if I'd like to make the switch to Android completely.

So it begins.
