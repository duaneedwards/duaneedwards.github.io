## Project Debrief

I thought I'd do a debrief of project to recap on what went well, where my time went whilst completing the Hard Boiled project.

I think the interesting observation that I made was that I honestly spent more time grappling with Android's layout system and trying to get the RadialProgressView to work how I wanted it to.

There was certainly times where I was struggling to translate my knowledge of C# into something that could be used within F#, but this was rarely a blocking issue for too long.
